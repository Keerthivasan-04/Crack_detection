# Crack_detection

This study proposes an automated crack detection 
system CNN and U-Net model to identify surface defects in 
concrete, tiles, roads, buildings, and oil tanker vehicles. The 
combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 
feature extraction and U-Net for precise segmentation ensures 
high accuracy in crack localization. The model is trained on a 
diverse dataset and optimized to handle challenges such as 
lighting variations, background noise, and complex textures. 
Experimental results show that the system achieves an accuracy 
of 
95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world 
applications. The proposed system contributes to structural 
health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and AI-driven 
inspection, providing scalable and efficient solutions for civil 
engineering, transportation, and industrial safety applications
